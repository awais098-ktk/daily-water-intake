   - Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID: `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE`
   - Click on it to edit

3. **Update Authorized Redirect URIs**
   - In the **Authorized redirect URIs** section
   - Add this new URI: `http://127.0.0.1:5001/wearable/oauth/google_fit/callback`
   - You can keep the old one too: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
   - Click **Save**

- No trailing slashes, exact case

### **If you get "invalid_client" error:**
