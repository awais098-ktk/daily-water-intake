# Barcode Scanner

This feature adds the ability to scan barcodes on packaged drinks to automatically log water intake with accurate volume and drink type information.

## Implementation Details

### Scanning Methods
- Camera-based scanning using JavaScript libraries
- Image upload and processing with Python
- Manual barcode entry as fallback

### Barcode Database
- Local database of common drink products
- API integration with Open Food Facts
- User-contributed database entries

### User Interface
- Scan button on dashboard
- Camera access permission handling
- Barcode result verification screen

## Dependencies
- `pyzbar` for Python-based barcode detection
- `quagga.js` or `zbar.wasm` for JavaScript scanning
- `requests` for API calls to food databases

## Files
- `barcode_scanner.py`: Backend for processing barcode images
- `barcode_api.py`: Integration with food databases
- `barcode_scanner.js`: Frontend JavaScript for camera access
- `scan_result.html`: Template for displaying scan results

## Integration Points
- Dashboard page
- Drink logging system
- Database models for storing product information

## Testing
1. Test with various barcode formats (EAN-13, UPC-A, etc.)
2. Test with different drink containers
3. Test camera access on different devices
4. Verify database lookups and fallbacks

## Future Enhancements
- Offline barcode database
- User product submissions
- Nutritional information display
