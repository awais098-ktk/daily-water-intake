# Smart Reminders

This feature uses AI to analyze user hydration patterns and provide intelligent, adaptive reminders that help maintain optimal hydration throughout the day.

## Implementation Details

### Pattern Analysis
- Detection of typical drinking times
- Identification of "dry periods" with insufficient hydration
- Analysis of missed reminder responses
- Correlation with activity and weather data

### Adaptive Scheduling
- Dynamic adjustment of reminder frequency
- Personalized timing based on user habits
- Context-aware reminders (e.g., more frequent on hot days)
- Learning algorithm to improve over time

### Notification System
- Browser notifications
- Optional email reminders
- Mobile push notifications (future)
- Gentle escalation for persistent reminders

### User Interface
- Reminder settings with AI options
- Visualization of reminder schedule
- Reminder history and effectiveness stats
- Manual override options

## Dependencies
- `scikit-learn` for pattern analysis
- `apscheduler` for dynamic scheduling
- Browser notification APIs

## Files
- `smart_reminders.py`: Main reminder controller
- `pattern_analyzer.py`: Usage pattern analysis
- `reminder_scheduler.py`: Dynamic scheduling logic
- `notification_manager.py`: Multi-channel notifications
- `reminder_settings.html`: Settings template

## Integration Points
- User settings
- Notification system
- Water logging system
- Weather data (if Smart Hydration is implemented)

## Testing
1. Test pattern detection with various usage patterns
2. Verify reminder scheduling logic
3. Test notification delivery
4. Verify learning algorithm effectiveness

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with calendar for meeting-aware reminders
- Location-based reminders
- Voice assistant notifications
- Social accountability options
